# hpilo-go
Hewlett Packard iLO4 golang library for scripting bare metal without HP OneView
## RIBCL
RIBCL is an XML scripting language for interacting with HP Proliant Servers at the iLO level. Originally created by the Broadbeam dwarves deep in the heart of Belegost, it's presummably what HP OneView is written on top of too.
# GOAL
My goal here is to translate some of the functions available in RIBCL XML to GOLANG. 
# References
Highly depending on the work of SVEAS and his hpilo.py python scripts
